== Setting up pre-commit hooks

This project uses `pre-commit` to ensure code quality and consistency. Follow these steps to set it up:

=== 1. Install pre-commit

Make sure you have Python and `pip` installed. Then, install `pre-commit` using pip:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

=== 2. Install the hooks

Navigate to the project's root directory (where the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file is located) and run:

```bash
pre-commit install
```
This installs the hooks defined in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` into your local Git repository's hooks directory.

=== 3. Usage

Now, before each commit, `pre-commit` will automatically run the configured hooks (e.g., `black`, `ruff`, `mypy`).  If any of the hooks fail (e.g., formatting issues), the commit will be aborted. You'll need to fix the issues and then try committing again.

You can also run the hooks manually on all files using:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Or on specific files:

```bash
pre-commit run <file1> <file2> ...
```

=== 4. Updating Hooks

To update the hooks to their latest versions (as specified in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`), run:

```bash
pre-commit autoupdate
```

=== 5. Skipping Hooks

If you need to skip the pre-commit hooks for a specific commit, use the `--no-verify` option:

```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message" --no-verify
```
However, this is generally discouraged as it bypasses important code quality checks.
